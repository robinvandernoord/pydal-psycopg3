# pydal-psycopg3

`pydal-psycopg3` is a proof-of-concept driver for [pyDAL](https://github.com/web2py/pydal), demonstrating integration
with [psycopg3](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/) as a drop-in replacement for the psycopg2 driver. The goal is to
ensure databases relying on `psycopg2` functionality can seamlessly transition to `psycopg3` while preserving the same
driver schemes.

## Key Features

- **Drop-In Replacement**: The module is designed to work with existing `psycopg2` configurations.
- **Custom Scheme Support**: Supports both the original "postgres" scheme and a custom "postgres:psycopg3" scheme for
  explicit usage.
- **Compatibility with pyDAL**: Built as a registerable driver, compatible with the DAL object.

## Installation

To use this driver, install the package and its dependencies:

```bash
(uv) pip install pydal-psycopg3
# or to include the prebuilt driver:
(uv) pip install pydal-psycopg3 psycopg-binary
```

## Getting Started

To integrate `pydal-psycopg3`, use the following setup:

```python
from pydal import DAL

# Required to register the driver
import pydal_psycopg3

# Using the original scheme
db = DAL("postgres://someuser:somepass@localhost:5432/postgres")

# Or using the explicit psycopg3 scheme
db = DAL("postgres:psycopg3://someuser:somepass@localhost:5432/postgres")
```

Both approaches ensure the driver works transparently.

### Example Usage

- Define tables and perform queries just like with `psycopg2`. Here's a minimal example to get started:

```python
# Defining a table
db.define_table("example_table", db.Field("example_field"))

# Inserting data
db.example_table.insert(example_field="test data")
db.commit()

# Querying the table
rows = db(db.example_table).select()
print(rows)
```

### Driver Registration

The driver registers itself automatically when `imported` and works with either of the following schemes:

1. `postgres://` – The default scheme connects using `psycopg3` as the driver.
2. `postgres:psycopg3://` – An explicitly declared scheme to use `psycopg3`.

## Limitations

This module is in its **proof-of-concept** phase and should be used with caution in production environments.
While most functionalities are expected to work as intended, thorough testing is recommended.
